# esxFivem

- Hello guys. I made a fivem ready esx server. Many people have been asking for this, although there are many like this out there.
I'm still gonna upload this because its 100% working fine. I've been using it, and tested in many times so you're set.

In the cfx-server-data you have a readme file
